# Final_Project_Geog371

Project title: Parks in Benton County and Corvallis

Project description: An update of the original story map project with addtional text, images, links, and new formatting. 

 The Goal of this project is to introudce the area of Benton County within Oregon, then continue by going a level deeper each scene, type; management; playground; and finally dog access. This is all to give a better understanding about parks because its not known by everyone that there are different people managing all the parks in the county and that there is differen't designations and rules for each 

The core of the system architecture is based on mapbox basemap styles and built up from there, adding geojson features over them, with a javascript story map laid ontop of that. This was done this way becasue it was the same as the original story map that was created and it was the simiplist way i could think to do it , (2) the main functions of your web map using either a screenshot of the web map or a code snippet of the function, and a concomitant description.

Reflection on the course of designing your web map:

Data source

Libraries (e.g., Leaflet) and Web Services (e.g., github, basemap) in use

Credit

Acknowledgement

Other things necessary to inform the audience of your web map.
